The purpose of this assignment was to create a password generator using the 4 character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols.
the user is asked how many characters you would like and confirm whether you would want to use all for types or just a few. You would then press the generate password button to create a password of that length. There are 2 versions of the javascript file. Version 1 is incomplete but the user is able to decide what length and character type they want however a password isnt generated. Version 2 or "script.js" has a working password generator that allows the user to decide the length however it uses all character types.
